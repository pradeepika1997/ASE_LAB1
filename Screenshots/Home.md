## About GitHub : 
GitHub is a **distributed** Version control system ( also known as Source code management) used for tracking changes to the file(s).
* GitHub provides a platform for multiple developers to work simultaneously.
* GitHub adds flexibility to developers to keep track of file changes locally during offline and can later push changes to server when required.
* GitHub is heavily used for open source projects.

### Version Control System(VCS) :
There are 2 types of VCS 1) Centralized VCS and 2) Distributed VCS
1) Centralized VCS : It works on a client-server mechanism. Client will be downloading only a single set of files from a remote repository to a local repository.

Examples: Concurrent VCS(CVS), SubVersion(SVN)

2) Distributed VCS : Each client acts as a separate VCS. Client will get the full history of files in the repository downloaded in the system.
It is time efficient compared to Centralized VCS. Only push and pop requests are handled by the server. Other all git commands are handled by the local repository allowing user to track files in offline mode.

Examples: GitHub, Mercurial, Bazaar

### Operations done on GitHub:
* Create a repository on GitHub and copy the clone link.
* Get the local copy of the remote repository on the client machine.

`git clone remote_repository_clone_link`

* Steps for adding new file to the remote repository 

`git add file_name` ( --> Adds the new file to the staging area )

`git commit` ( --> Checks for files in staging area, and modified files. If present commit the files to the local repository) 

`git push` ( --> All files in the commit history are pushed to the remote repository on the server )

* Steps for creating a branch

clone the repository to the local system from server and execute

`git branch` ( --> to get list of all branches for the cloned repository )  

`git branch branch_name` ( --> to create a new branch and also changes the current local repository to the branch)

(or) `git checkout -b branch_name`

* Steps for creating a tag

clone the repository to the local system from server and execute

`git tag tag_name`

* Steps to update the local repository

`git pull`
